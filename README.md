# EPMS
EPMS is a management system developed for a startup poultry farm business called Eggcellent Palace. It was developed as a final course project of Ashesi University's Web Technology class.

These activities include egg sales, feed consumption tracking, managing the number of eggs in stock, the number of birds in the farm, flock production, and finally keeping the salary records of the employees who work on the farm. So, the activities are grouped into the following categories:
